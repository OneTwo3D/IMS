// Payment-reversal detection (audit-M-acct #3)
//
// The Xero payment poller is forward-only: it queries Status=="PAID" invoices
// modified since the last poll and sets paidAt on the matching IMS document. If a
// payment is later reversed/deleted in Xero, the invoice regresses to AUTHORISED
// but the poller never clears paidAt — IMS keeps showing the document as paid.
// This pairs the forward poll with a reversal pass: of the documents IMS thinks
// are paid, which now have a non-paid (AUTHORISED) Xero invoice in the polled
// window? Those get paidAt rolled back. Pure set intersection, unit-tested.
