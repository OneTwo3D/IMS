/**
 * The email outbox: enqueue (`queueEmail`) and drain (`processPendingEmailOutbox`).
 *
 * o3d-alnk — WHY THE CLAIM CARRIES A TOKEN AND EVERY TERMINAL WRITE IS AN updateMany.
 *
 * The drain reclaims a PROCESSING row on elapsed time alone (`processingStartedAt <
 * now - EMAIL_CLAIM_STALE_MS`). That is a statement about TIME, not about outcome: it
 * cannot tell a dead holder from a slow one. On its own that is survivable — it costs at
 * most one duplicate send, and nothing local can retract an SMTP message anyway. What made
 * it a P1 is what happened NEXT. Every terminal write used to be
 * `update({ where: { id } })`, keyed on the id and nothing else, so:
 *
 *   t0     worker A claims row R and calls sendEmail; the socket stalls
 *   t0+15m worker B finds R stale, reclaims it, SENDS THE EMAIL AGAIN, writes SENT
 *   t0+16m A's send returns a retryable failure. A writes status PENDING, attempts+1,
 *          availableAt = now + backoff — OVER B's SENT. The row is RE-ARMED and a THIRD
 *          copy goes out on the next tick.
 *
 * The loser did not merely duplicate: it reopened a row the winner had settled, so the
 * duplication was not bounded at two and did not converge on its own.
 *
 * THE FIX IS A FENCE, NOT A LONGER TIMEOUT. `lockedBy` holds a per-CLAIM random token —
 * deliberately not a per-duty constant like the integration outbox's `lockedBy`, because two
 * runs of the same cron would then write the same value and only the timestamp would
 * discriminate. Every terminal write repeats `(id, status PROCESSING, lockedBy,
 * processingStartedAt)` in its WHERE. The reclaimed worker still ISSUES its UPDATE; Postgres
 * matches zero rows and REFUSES it. Refused, not skipped: there is no `if (stillMine)` in
 * front of the write, because a read-then-write check is itself racy and would put the guard
 * between the resume and the effect rather than making the effect's write conditional.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT FIX, STATED PLAINLY. The duplicate SEND at t0+15m still happens. The
 * fence sits between the reclaim and the ROW, and no local write can un-send an email
 * (o3d-ic9a property B). What it removes is the RE-ARM, which is the unbounded part, and it
 * makes the losing worker's outcome observable (`conflicted`) instead of silent.
 *
 * THE ENQUEUE SIDE IS GUARDED SEPARATELY, IN THE DATABASE. The fence protects one row from
 * being settled twice; it says nothing about two ROWS being created for one logical email.
 * A partial UNIQUE index — `email_outbox_undelivered_reference_uq` on
 * (kind, referenceType, referenceId) WHERE status IN ('PENDING','PROCESSING') — makes a
 * second UNDELIVERED row impossible rather than merely unlikely. See the migration
 * 20260910120000_email_outbox_claim_fence for why it is scoped to undelivered statuses.
