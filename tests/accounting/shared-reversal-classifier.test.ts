/**
 * o3d-psrx r3 (Codex HIGH) — ONE CASE TABLE, BOTH ENTRY POINTS.
 *
 * Codex's first instruction was to reuse the Xero decision path rather than write a second one, and
 * to say — if the two cannot literally be one function — how they are kept in agreement. They CAN be:
 * `classifyRegisteredPayment` is now `classifyRegisteredPaymentAgainstListing` plus the one line that
 * reads a Xero invoice's `Payments[]`. So agreement is not maintained by discipline, it is maintained
 * by there being one implementation — and this file is the proof of that claim rather than a
 * restatement of it.
 *
 * THE TABLE BELOW IS DRIVEN THROUGH BOTH DOORS and asserted EQUAL, case by case. If somebody re-inlines
 * the decision into the Xero entry point, the two can diverge and this is what notices — the same
 * technique that kept the two bill-payment fences in step on o3d-batch-ret.
 *
 * THE QUICKBOOKS COLUMN is the second half. QuickBooks' reversal read enumerates no payments at all, so
 * its listing is always NULL — and null is "absence cannot be established", never "no payments". Every
 * case therefore states what the SAME evidence decides for a connector that cannot enumerate, which is
 * exactly what `gateQboReversalsOnProvenance` acts on.
