# Xero Accounting Sync

One Two Inventory integrates with Xero to keep your accounting records in sync. The system acts as a **sub-ledger** — Xero handles invoicing, payments, and bank reconciliation, while the IMS creates daily correction journals to control when revenue is recognised and how inventory flows through your accounts.

## Connection Setup

1. Go to **Sync → Xero** and enter your Xero app **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
2. Click **Connect to Xero** — you'll be redirected to Xero to authorise the connection
3. Once connected, click **Sync Chart of Accounts** to pull your Xero account list
4. Map each IMS transaction type to the correct Xero account (see Account Mapping below)
5. Enable **Xero Sync** and save settings

## Account Mapping

| IMS Account | Xero Account Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Sales Revenue | Revenue | Income from sales invoices |
| Shipping Income | Revenue | Shipping charges on sales |
| Discounts Given | Revenue / Expense | Order-level discounts |
| Purchases | Direct Cost | Default account for purchase bills |
| Stock in Transit | Asset | Goods ordered but not yet received |
| Inventory Asset | Asset | Stock on hand (available) |
| Allocated Inventory | Asset | Stock reserved for paid orders awaiting dispatch |
| Cost of Goods Sold | Direct Cost | COGS booked when goods ship |
| Unearned Revenue | Liability | Revenue deferred until goods ship |

## How Sync Works — Flowchart

The flowchart below shows every path an order can take through the Xero sub-ledger, from payment through to shipment. The daily batch runs Groups A1 → A2 → B in sequence each night.

## Sync Cases in Detail

### Case 1: WooCommerce Order (stock available, same-day ship)

This is the most common case. The customer pays via WooCommerce, stock is available and allocated, and the order ships quickly.

| Step | What Happens | Xero Journal |
|---|---|---|
| WC order syncs | AUTHORISED invoice created, payment registered | Invoice + Payment |
| Daily batch A1 | Revenue deferred (money received, goods not yet shipped) | DR Sales / CR Unearned Revenue |
| Daily batch A2 | Stock reclassified (reserved for this order) | DR Allocated / CR Inventory |
| Order ships | Stock dispatched, cost layers consumed | — |
| Daily batch B | Revenue recognised, COGS booked | DR Unearned / CR Sales + DR COGS / CR Allocated |

### Case 2: WooCommerce Order (backorder — no stock)

The customer pays but the item is out of stock. Revenue is deferred immediately, but inventory reclassification waits until stock arrives.

| Step | What Happens | Xero Journal |
|---|---|---|
| WC order syncs | AUTHORISED invoice, payment registered, no stock to allocate | Invoice + Payment |
| Daily batch A1 | Revenue deferred immediately | DR Sales / CR Unearned Revenue |
| *Time passes...* | Waiting for stock | — |
| PO received | Stock arrives, IMS auto-allocates the order | — |
| Daily batch A2 | Stock now allocated, reclassified | DR Allocated / CR Inventory |
| Order ships | Stock dispatched | — |
| Daily batch B | Revenue recognised, COGS booked | DR Unearned / CR Sales + DR COGS / CR Allocated |

### Case 3: Manual Order (invoice-first)

A manual order is created in the IMS. A DRAFT invoice is pushed to Xero. Payment is detected when the customer pays via bank transfer and the bank feed matches.

| Step | What Happens | Xero Journal |
|---|---|---|
| Order created | DRAFT invoice in Xero | Invoice (DRAFT) |
| Customer pays | Bank feed matches in Xero | — |
| Payment poll | IMS detects paid invoice, sets paidAt, advances status | — |
| Daily batch A1 | Revenue deferred | DR Sales / CR Unearned Revenue |
| Allocate + ship | Normal flow from here | A2 then B |

### Case 4: Partial Shipment (multi-warehouse)

An order is split across two warehouses. Each shipment is processed independently in Group B, with revenue proportioned by line value.

| Step | What Happens | Xero Journal |
|---|---|---|
| Order paid + allocated | Split across Warehouse A and Warehouse B | A1 + A2 |
| Shipment 1 ships | Warehouse A portion | — |
| Daily batch B | Revenue + COGS for Shipment 1's proportion | Partial DR Unearned / CR Sales + DR COGS / CR Allocated |
| Shipment 2 ships | Warehouse B portion | — |
| Daily batch B | Remaining revenue + COGS | Remaining DR Unearned / CR Sales + DR COGS / CR Allocated |

## Refund Handling

Refunds create a Xero credit note in all cases. Additional reversal journals depend on how far the order progressed through the sub-ledger:

| Order State | What Gets Reversed |
|---|---|
| Paid but not yet batched (A1 not run) | Credit note only — no journals to reverse |
| Revenue deferred, not allocated (backorder) | Credit note + DR Unearned Revenue / CR Sales |
| Allocated but not shipped | Credit note + DR Unearned / CR Sales + DR Inventory / CR Allocated |
| Partially or fully shipped | Credit note + DR Inventory / CR COGS (shipped portion) + unearned reversal (unshipped portion) |

## Transaction Types

Configure which documents are synced to Xero under **Sync → Xero → Transaction Types**. Each type can be set to **Off**, **Draft**, or **Submitted** (AUTHORISED in Xero):

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| Sales Invoices | Push invoices to Xero when an order is created |
| Credit Notes | Push credit notes on refund |
| Purchase Bills | Push supplier bills when a PO is invoiced |
| Stock Receipts | Journal: DR Inventory / CR Stock in Transit on goods received |
| COGS Reversals | Reverse COGS on stock returns |
| Inventory Adjustments | Journal for manual stock adjustments |

## Sub-Ledger Settings

### Daily Batch Sync

When enabled, the nightly cron job runs three groups in sequence:

- **Group A1 — Revenue Deferral**: Any paid order that hasn't been deferred yet. Prevents Xero from showing inflated revenue before goods ship.
- **Group A2 — Inventory Reclassification**: Allocated orders only. Moves stock value from Available to Allocated on the balance sheet.
- **Group B — Shipment Recognition**: Per-shipment. Recognises revenue and books COGS using FIFO cost layer consumption.

### Payment Polling

When enabled, the IMS polls Xero every 15 minutes for:

- **Paid sales invoices** (manual orders only — WC orders arrive pre-paid)
- **Paid purchase bills** (all POs — detects when a bill is paid via bank feed)

## Invoice PDF & Email

When a sales invoice is synced to Xero and payment is registered:

1. The Xero invoice PDF is downloaded and saved locally
2. The PDF is emailed to the customer with a branded email template
3. A signed download link is pushed to the WooCommerce order as a customer-visible note
4. An admin-only note with a "View in Xero" link is added to the WC order

Invoice PDFs are accessible via a signed URL: `/api/invoices/[orderId]?token=<hmac>`. The token is generated using HMAC-SHA256 and verified with timing-safe comparison.

## Xero Deep Links

When an order or purchase invoice has been synced to Xero, a **View in Xero** link appears on the detail page:

- **Sales orders**: Links to `https://go.xero.com/AccountsReceivable/View.aspx?InvoiceID=...`
- **Purchase orders**: Links to `https://go.xero.com/AccountsPayable/View.aspx?InvoiceID=...`

## Payment Method Mapping

The IMS maps payment methods to Xero bank accounts using a composite key of `{method}:{currency}`. This allows different bank accounts for different payment processors and currencies:

- `stripe:GBP` → Stripe GBP clearing account
- `stripe:EUR` → Stripe EUR clearing account
- `paypal:GBP` → PayPal GBP account
- `bacs:GBP` → Business bank account

Configure this mapping in **Sync → Xero → Payment Account Mapping**.

## FIFO Cost Layers

Group B of the daily batch consumes FIFO (First In, First Out) cost layers when booking COGS. Each shipment line decrements `remainingQty` on the oldest cost layers first. This ensures COGS reflects the actual purchase cost of the specific units shipped.

## Cron Endpoints

| Endpoint | Schedule | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/api/cron/accounting-sync` | Every 5 min | Process pending accounting sync entries (invoices, journals) |
| `/api/cron/accounting-daily-batch` | Daily (midnight) | Run sub-ledger Groups A1, A2, B |
| `/api/cron/accounting-payment-poll` | Every 15 min | Detect paid invoices and bills in the active accounting connector |

All cron endpoints require the `CRON_SECRET` header or localhost origin.

## Sync Log

The sync log at **Sync → Xero** shows all queued transactions with their status:

- **Pending** — Queued, waiting for next cron run
- **Synced** — Successfully pushed to Xero (shows Xero transaction ID)
- **Failed** — Failed after 5 retries (shows error message)

Failed entries can be investigated via the error message and retried by resetting their status in the database.
