## Request Flow

### Web Request (Server Action)

```
Browser --> nginx --> Next.js Server Component
                    +-- Auth.js: validate JWT session
                    +-- Server Action: validate + mutate via Prisma
                    +-- revalidatePath / redirect
```

### API Route (PDF / Export / Cron)

```
Client --> nginx --> Next.js Route Handler (/api/...)
                   +-- Auth check (where applicable)
                   +-- Prisma query
                   +-- Response (JSON / PDF stream / CSV)
```


## Database Design

### Core Principles

**FIFO COGS** — Each goods receipt (purchase receive or opening stock) creates a `CostLayer` with a unit cost and remaining quantity. When stock is consumed (sale dispatch, adjustment, etc.), cost layers are consumed oldest-first per product per warehouse, creating `CogsEntry` records.

**Multi-currency** — Every monetary record stores both foreign-currency and base-currency amounts:
- `*Foreign` fields: amount in the transaction currency
- `*Base` fields: value in the organisation base currency at the time of transaction
- `fxRateToBase`: the exchange rate used. Convention: 1 base = X document-currency (matches frankfurter/ECB output direction).
- The same rate is pushed downstream to Xero on every invoice/bill/credit note (as `CurrencyRate`, inverted) so the accounting platform never substitutes its own daily rate. See `docs/xero-sync.md` § Multi-Currency FX Rates.

**Landed costs** — A freight PO (`type = FREIGHT`) is linked to a goods PO via `LandedCostLink`. When the goods PO is received, landed costs are distributed across cost layers. Distribution methods: by value, by weight, by quantity, or equal split.

**Stock reservation** — `StockLevel.reservedQty` tracks stock that is allocated but not yet dispatched. Transfers in `IN_TRANSIT` status reserve stock on the source warehouse.

### Quantity Constraint Monitoring

The database and the invariant report intentionally overlap on core quantity integrity checks:

| Database CHECK Constraint | Inventory Invariant Code |
|---|---|
| `stock_levels_quantity_nonnegative` | `stock_negative_quantity` |
| `stock_levels_reserved_nonnegative` | `stock_negative_reserved_quantity` |
| `cost_layers_received_nonnegative` | `cost_layer_negative_received_quantity` |
| `cost_layers_remaining_qty_non_negative` | `cost_layer_negative_remaining_quantity` |
| `cost_layers_remaining_qty_lte_received_qty` | `cost_layer_remaining_exceeds_received` |
| `stock_movements_qty_nonnegative` | `stock_movement_negative_quantity` |

The CHECK constraints prevent new bad writes. The invariant report remains the read-only backstop for historical drift, manual SQL damage, and rollout verification.

**Discount storage** — Discounts are stored separately as `discountStr` (the original input) and `discountAmount` (the computed value). Prices are never baked with discounts applied.

**Tax rate snapshotting** — Sales orders store `taxRateName` and `taxRatePercent` at creation time, ensuring historical accuracy if tax rates change later.

**Key-value settings store** — The `Setting` model provides a generic key-value store with JSON-encoded values for all application configuration that does not warrant its own table.

### Product Types

| Type | Description | Stockable | Has Components |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SIMPLE` | Standalone product | Yes | No |
| `VARIABLE` | Parent grouping for variants | No | No |
| `VARIANT` | Child of a VARIABLE parent, own SKU | Yes | No |
| `KIT` | Virtual bundle — components deducted on sale; can also sit under a VARIABLE parent as a bundle variant | Calculated | Yes |
| `BOM` | Manufactured product — stock exists after production; can also sit under a VARIABLE parent as a BOM variant | Yes | Yes |
| `NON_INVENTORY` | Service or fee — not stock-tracked | No | No |

Transform rules:

- `VARIABLE` remains a pure parent and cannot be transformed through the standard editor.
- `NON_INVENTORY` cannot be transformed through the standard editor.
- `SIMPLE`, `VARIANT`, `KIT`, and `BOM` can be transformed only when the product has no attached stock or open operational records.
- Blockers include stock on hand, reserved stock, open sales order lines, open purchase order lines, open production orders, and open transfer lines.
- This prevents converting bundles or BOMs back to simple products while operational state is still attached.

### Key Models

**Core Inventory:**
- `Product` — all product types, with SKU, pricing, dimensions, weight, stock unit, images, HS code, country of origin
- `ProductOption` — variant options (e.g. Colour, Size) with comma-separated values

## Authentication

Auth.js v5 with two providers:

### Credentials Provider
1. User submits email + password on the login page
2. Server verifies the bcrypt hash stored in `User.passwordHash`
3. If `User.totpEnabled = true`, a TOTP challenge screen is shown
4. On success, Auth.js creates a signed JWT session cookie (30-day expiry)

### Passkey Provider (WebAuthn)
1. User clicks "Sign in with Passkey" on the login page
2. Browser performs WebAuthn authentication with a registered credential
3. Server verifies the assertion against stored public keys
4. Session is created without requiring TOTP (passkey is already strong authentication)

User roles: `ADMIN`, `MANAGER`, `WAREHOUSE`, `FINANCE`, `READONLY`, `SUPPLIER`.

A permission system (`lib/permissions.ts`) controls sidebar visibility and server action authorisation per role. Supplier users are linked to a supplier company and access a dedicated portal.


## Background Tasks

There is no separate worker process. Background tasks are handled via HTTP endpoints triggered by system cron jobs.

| Task | Endpoint | Schedule | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| FX rate refresh | `GET /api/cron/fx-rates` | Daily 06:00 | Fetch rates from frankfurter.dev and upsert FxRate rows |
| Activity cleanup | `GET /api/cron/activity-cleanup` | Daily 03:00 | Purge activity log entries past retention |
| Scheduled backup | `GET /api/cron/backup` | Daily 02:00 | Create backup, apply retention, upload to remote storage |
| WooCommerce reconcile | `GET /api/cron/wc-reconcile` | Daily | Backup reconciliation for WooCommerce orders/products plus stock catch-up and queued retry draining |
| Delivery status | `GET /api/cron/delivery-status` | Every 15 min | Poll delivery tracking providers for shipment status updates |

All cron endpoints require the `CRON_SECRET` bearer header in production. Localhost bypass is available outside production only when no `CRON_SECRET` is configured; in production it is disabled unless `CRON_SECRET` is unset and `ALLOW_LOCALHOST_CRON_BYPASS=true` is set explicitly.


## PDF Generation

PDFs are generated server-side using PDFKit (configured as `serverExternalPackages` in `next.config.ts`). The PDF system lives in `lib/pdf.ts` and provides:

- `getBranding()` — reads company info, logos, and brand colours from the Organisation and Settings tables
- `createPdfDocument()` — creates an A4 PDFDocument with standard margins and helpers
- `drawHeader()` — async function for rendering the document header with logo and addresses (all routes now correctly `await` this call)
- Table drawing utilities for consistent formatting across document types
- SVG logo conversion via sharp, with path traversal guard on logo file loading
- Auto-contrast text colour calculation
- All template fields loaded: headerNote, footerNote, termsText, paymentTermsText, customFooter
- TO address renders on separate lines (not comma-separated)

### Email Sending

Outbound email is handled by `lib/mailer.ts` using nodemailer:

- SMTP configuration from Settings (host, port, security, credentials)
- `sendSalesOrderEmail()` — sends sales order PDF as attachment
- `sendInvoiceEmail()` — sends invoice PDF as attachment
- Email buttons in the UI send via SMTP server-side (not mailto links)

PDF types: Sales Order, Purchase Order, Invoice, Packing Slip, Credit Note, RFQ, Manufacturing Order.

PDFs are streamed directly as responses from route handlers.


## CSV Import/Export

**Export routes** (under `/api/export/`): products, stock-levels, adjustments, contacts, suppliers, sales, transfers, purchase-orders.

**Import features:**
- Product CSV import with two-pass processing (parents first, then variants/components)
- Stock adjustment CSV import
- Customer and supplier CSV import

CSV utilities are in `lib/csv.ts`.


## External Integrations

### Xero

Xero integration is implemented as a modular connector in `lib/connectors/xero/`, fully independent of any shopping channel module.

- **Sub-ledger model** — IMS acts as accounting guard; Xero handles invoicing, payments, and bank reconciliation; IMS creates daily correction journals
- **Sales invoices** — AUTHORISED (WC pre-paid) or DRAFT (manual) invoice created at order time, with automatic Xero payment registration
- **Purchase bills** — pushed when a PO is invoiced, with optional supplier invoice PDF attachment
- **Credit notes** — pushed on refund with sub-ledger state-aware reversal journals
- **Daily batch sync** — nightly cron runs Group A1 (revenue deferral), A2 (inventory reclassification), B (shipment COGS + revenue recognition via FIFO cost layer consumption)
- **Payment polling** — 15-min cron detects paid invoices (manual orders) and paid bills (POs) via Xero API
- **Invoice PDF** — downloaded from Xero, saved locally, emailed to customer, download link pushed to WC order
- **Payment method mapping** — composite `{method}:{currency}` key maps to Xero bank account codes
- **OAuth 2.0** — tokens stored at `XERO_TOKEN_PATH`, refreshed before each API call
- **Deep links** — "View in Xero" links on sales order and PO detail pages

### WooCommerce

WooCommerce integration is implemented as a modular connector in `lib/connectors/woocommerce/`, following the shared `ShoppingConnector` and `AccountingConnector` interfaces.

- **Order import** — webhook-first via `/api/webhooks/shopping/orders`, with `/api/cron/wc-reconcile` as backup reconciliation
- **Status sync** — bidirectional mapping between WC and IMS statuses (configurable via `WcStatusMapping` with seeded defaults matching WC flowchart)
- **Refund sync** — creates refund records with credit notes and COGS reversal, via webhook (`/api/webhooks/shopping/refunds`)
- **Product sync** — bidirectional product data sync via webhook (`/api/webhooks/shopping/products`), including prices, dimensions, weight, GTIN/EAN (`global_unique_id`), HS code, and country of origin from WC product attributes
- **Stock sync** — IMS to WC, pushed immediately from IMS changes with daily forced stock catch-up and queued retry draining in the reconcile cron; optional COGS sync toggle
- **Tax class mapping** — maps WC tax classes to IMS TaxRate records
- **Completion flow** — WC completed status triggers auto-allocation, shipment creation with tracking
- **Webhook security** — HMAC verification using timing-safe comparison (`timingSafeEqual`)

### Integrations Dashboard

The `/sync` page provides a unified view of all connectors:

- **WooCommerce** — connection settings, order/product/stock sync config, tax mapping, status mapping, sync log
- **Xero** — OAuth connection, account mapping, transaction type toggles, sub-ledger settings, payment method mapping, sync log
- **Shopify** — tile shown (coming soon)
- **QuickBooks** — tile shown (coming soon)
- **REST API** — tile with endpoint documentation
