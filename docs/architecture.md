## Request Flow

### Web Request (Server Action)

```
Browser --> nginx --> Next.js Server Component
                    +-- Auth.js: validate JWT session
                    +-- Server Action: validate + mutate via Prisma
                    +-- revalidatePath / redirect
```

### API Route (PDF / Export / Cron)

```
Client --> nginx --> Next.js Route Handler (/api/...)
                   +-- Auth check (where applicable)
                   +-- Prisma query
                   +-- Response (JSON / PDF stream / CSV)
```


## Database Design

### Core Principles

**FIFO COGS** — Each goods receipt (purchase receive or opening stock) creates a `CostLayer` with a unit cost and remaining quantity. When stock is consumed (sale dispatch, adjustment, etc.), cost layers are consumed oldest-first per product per warehouse, creating `CogsEntry` records.

**Multi-currency** — Every monetary record stores both foreign-currency and GBP amounts:
- `*Foreign` fields: amount in the transaction currency
- `*Gbp` fields: GBP equivalent at the time of transaction
- `fxRateToGbp`: the exchange rate used

**Landed costs** — A freight PO (`type = FREIGHT`) is linked to a goods PO via `LandedCostLink`. When the goods PO is received, landed costs are distributed across cost layers. Distribution methods: by value, by weight, by quantity, or equal split.

**Stock reservation** — `StockLevel.reservedQty` tracks stock that is allocated but not yet dispatched. Transfers in `IN_TRANSIT` status reserve stock on the source warehouse.

**Discount storage** — Discounts are stored separately as `discountStr` (the original input) and `discountAmount` (the computed value). Prices are never baked with discounts applied.

**Tax rate snapshotting** — Sales orders store `taxRateName` and `taxRatePercent` at creation time, ensuring historical accuracy if tax rates change later.

**Key-value settings store** — The `Setting` model provides a generic key-value store with JSON-encoded values for all application configuration that does not warrant its own table.

### Product Types

| Type | Description | Stockable | Has Components |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SIMPLE` | Standalone product | Yes | No |
| `VARIABLE` | Parent grouping for variants | No | No |
| `VARIANT` | Child of a VARIABLE parent, own SKU | Yes | No |
| `KIT` | Virtual bundle — components deducted on sale | Calculated | Yes |
| `BOM` | Manufactured product — stock exists after production | Yes | Yes |
| `NON_INVENTORY` | Service or fee — not stock-tracked | No | No |

|---|---|---|
| Inventory | `products.ts` | `/api/export/products`, `/api/export/stock-levels` |

| Activity Log | `activity-log.ts` | `/api/cron/activity-cleanup` |


## Authentication

Auth.js v5 with two providers:

### Credentials Provider
1. User submits email + password on the login page
2. Server verifies the bcrypt hash stored in `User.passwordHash`
3. If `User.totpEnabled = true`, a TOTP challenge screen is shown
4. On success, Auth.js creates a signed JWT session cookie (30-day expiry)

### Passkey Provider (WebAuthn)
1. User clicks "Sign in with Passkey" on the login page
2. Browser performs WebAuthn authentication with a registered credential
3. Server verifies the assertion against stored public keys
4. Session is created without requiring TOTP (passkey is already strong authentication)

User roles: `ADMIN`, `MANAGER`, `WAREHOUSE`, `FINANCE`, `READONLY`, `SUPPLIER`.

A permission system (`lib/permissions.ts`) controls sidebar visibility and server action authorisation per role. Supplier users are linked to a supplier company and access a dedicated portal.


## Background Tasks

There is no separate worker process. Background tasks are handled via HTTP endpoints triggered by system cron jobs.

| Task | Endpoint | Schedule | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| FX rate refresh | `GET /api/cron/fx-rates` | Daily 06:00 | Fetch rates from frankfurter.dev and upsert FxRate rows |
| Activity cleanup | `GET /api/cron/activity-cleanup` | Daily 03:00 | Purge activity log entries past retention |
| Scheduled backup | `GET /api/cron/backup` | Daily 02:00 | Create backup, apply retention, upload to remote storage |
| WooCommerce sync | `GET /api/cron/wc-sync` | Every 5 min | Poll WooCommerce for order, product, and stock changes |
| Delivery status | `GET /api/cron/delivery-status` | Every 15 min | Poll delivery tracking providers for shipment status updates |

All cron endpoints require the `CRON_SECRET` header or a request from localhost for security.


## PDF Generation

PDFs are generated server-side using PDFKit (configured as `serverExternalPackages` in `next.config.ts`). The PDF system lives in `lib/pdf.ts` and provides:

- `getBranding()` — reads company info, logos, and brand colours from the Organisation and Settings tables
- `createPdfDocument()` — creates an A4 PDFDocument with standard margins and helpers
- `drawHeader()` — async function for rendering the document header with logo and addresses (all routes now correctly `await` this call)
- Table drawing utilities for consistent formatting across document types
- SVG logo conversion via sharp, with path traversal guard on logo file loading
- Auto-contrast text colour calculation
- All template fields loaded: headerNote, footerNote, termsText, paymentTermsText, customFooter
- TO address renders on separate lines (not comma-separated)

### Email Sending

Outbound email is handled by `lib/mailer.ts` using nodemailer:

- SMTP configuration from Settings (host, port, security, credentials)
- `sendSalesOrderEmail()` — sends sales order PDF as attachment
- `sendInvoiceEmail()` — sends invoice PDF as attachment
- Email buttons in the UI send via SMTP server-side (not mailto links)

PDF types: Sales Order, Purchase Order, Invoice, Packing Slip, Credit Note, RFQ, Manufacturing Order.

PDFs are streamed directly as responses from route handlers.


## CSV Import/Export

**Export routes** (under `/api/export/`): products, stock-levels, adjustments, contacts, suppliers, sales, transfers, purchase-orders.

**Import features:**
- Product CSV import with two-pass processing (parents first, then variants/components)
- Stock adjustment CSV import
- Customer and supplier CSV import

CSV utilities are in `lib/csv.ts`.


## External Integrations

### Xero
- Purchase invoice sync — one journal per invoice (DR Inventory Asset, CR Accounts Payable)
- COGS sync — daily accumulated journal per product (DR COGS, CR Inventory Asset)
- OAuth 2.0 tokens stored at `XERO_TOKEN_PATH`, refreshed before each API call

### WooCommerce

WooCommerce integration is implemented as a modular connector in `lib/connectors/woocommerce/`, following the shared `ShoppingConnector` and `AccountingConnector` interfaces.

- **Order import** — via webhook (`/api/webhooks/woocommerce/orders`) or cron polling (`/api/cron/wc-sync`), with FX conversion
- **Status sync** — bidirectional mapping between WC and IMS statuses (configurable via `WcStatusMapping` with seeded defaults matching WC flowchart)
- **Refund sync** — creates refund records with credit notes and COGS reversal, via webhook (`/api/webhooks/woocommerce/refunds`)
- **Product sync** — bidirectional product data sync via webhook (`/api/webhooks/woocommerce/products`)
- **Stock sync** — IMS to WC, pushed per SKU across sync-enabled warehouses
- **Tax class mapping** — maps WC tax classes to IMS TaxRate records
- **Completion flow** — WC completed status triggers auto-allocation, shipment creation with tracking
- **Webhook security** — HMAC verification using timing-safe comparison (`timingSafeEqual`)

### Integrations Dashboard

The `/sync` page provides a unified view of all connectors:

- **WooCommerce** — connection settings, order/product/stock sync config, tax mapping, status mapping, sync log
- **Shopify** — tile shown (coming soon)
- **Xero** — tile shown (coming soon)
- **QuickBooks** — tile shown (coming soon)
- **REST API** — tile with endpoint documentation
