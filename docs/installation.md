# Installation & Deployment

## Prerequisites

- **Operating system**: Debian 11/12 or Ubuntu 22.04/24.04 (tested in LXC containers)
- **Node.js**: Version 22 (installed automatically by the install script)
- **PostgreSQL**: Version 14 or later (installed automatically, or provide an external connection)
- **nginx**: Used as the reverse proxy (installed automatically)
- **Internet access**: Required during installation for downloading packages


## The Install Script

Run the installer as root:

```bash
bash scripts/install.sh
```

The script performs the following steps:

1. **Pre-flight checks** — verifies root access, detects the OS, and checks internet connectivity
2. **Installs Node.js 22** via NodeSource
3. **Installs and configures PostgreSQL** — creates the database and user
4. **Installs nginx**, `fail2ban`, and automatic security updates
5. **Installs runtime tooling** used by deployment and maintenance scripts
6. **Prompts for configuration** values (see below)
7. **Creates the app system user** (`imsapp`)
8. **Deploys the application** — clones from git or copies from a local directory
9. **Installs npm dependencies** and builds the Next.js application
10. **Runs database migrations** via Prisma
11. **Optionally seeds public URL, SMTP settings, and a default admin user**
12. **Configures a native systemd service** for the application
13. **Configures nginx** as a reverse proxy
14. **Enables fail2ban and unattended security updates**
15. **Sets up cron jobs** for scheduled tasks
16. **Prints a post-install summary** with next steps

For unattended installation, use `--non-interactive` and set configuration values as environment variables.
For full Proxmox + Cloudflare + OpenLiteSpeed tenant rollout, see [Automated Tenant Provisioning](tenant-provisioning.md).


## Configuration Prompts

The installer asks for the following values during setup. Press Enter to accept the default shown in brackets.

### Application
- **Domain name** — the hostname for your installation (e.g. `ims.yourdomain.com`)
- **Internal port** — the port the app listens on (default: `3000`)
- **Default admin name/email/password** — optional bootstrap admin user for unattended installs
- **Notification email** — optional recipient for the bootstrap credentials email

After installation, sign in and set the organisation base currency in **Settings > Company** before entering live transactional data. The base currency is intended to be set once for a new system. Changing it later requires a database reset.

### Database
- **Install PostgreSQL** — install on this server, or connect to an external database
- **Database name** (default: `one_two_inventory`)
- **Database user** (default: `imsuser`)
- **Database password** — auto-generated if not provided

### Redis
- **Redis URL** (default: `redis://localhost:6379`)
- **Redis password** — leave blank if not required
- **Redis key prefix** — optional namespace for Redis-backed features

### WooCommerce (Optional)
- Store URL, consumer key, consumer secret, webhook secret
- Can be configured later in Settings

### Xero (Optional)
- Client ID and client secret
- Can be configured later in Settings

### Outbound Email (Optional)
- SMTP host, port, username, password, transport security
- From name, from email, reply-to
- Required if you want the installer to email the generated login details automatically

### nginx & SSL
- **Configure nginx** — set up the reverse proxy (default: yes)
- **Enable SSL** — obtain a Let's Encrypt certificate via certbot


## Directory Structure

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/opt/one-two-inventory` | Application root directory |
| `/opt/one-two-inventory/.env` | Environment configuration (chmod 600) |
| `/var/lib/one-two-inventory/backups` | Runtime backup storage directory used by backup create/restore/upload flows |
| `/var/lib/one-two-inventory/invoice-pdfs` | Accounting connector invoice PDFs served through signed invoice links |
| `/var/lib/one-two-inventory/uploads` | Private uploaded files served through authenticated routes, such as supplier invoice PDFs |
| `/var/lib/one-two-inventory/public-uploads/branding` | Logo and branding images served through `/api/uploads/branding/*` |
| `/var/lib/one-two-inventory/public-uploads/avatars` | User avatar images served through `/uploads/avatars/*` |
| `/var/lib/one-two-inventory` | Persistent data directory |
| `/var/log/one-two-inventory` | Application logs |

Container deployments must set `UPLOAD_STORAGE_DIR`,
`PUBLIC_UPLOAD_STORAGE_DIR`, and `INVOICE_PDF_STORAGE_DIR` to mounted
persistent volumes. If an upload storage variable is unset in production, IMS
logs a warning and falls back to local development paths under the application
working tree, which may be ephemeral in containers. Production preflight fails
when `INVOICE_PDF_STORAGE_DIR` is unset because signed invoice links depend on
persisted connector-downloaded PDFs.
Create `/var/lib/one-two-inventory/invoice-pdfs` during deployment with the same
owner as the IMS application process and restrictive permissions, for example
`chown app:app /var/lib/one-two-inventory/invoice-pdfs` and
`chmod 750 /var/lib/one-two-inventory/invoice-pdfs`. Connector PDFs are usually
re-fetchable from Xero or QuickBooks, so they do not need the same backup policy
as the database, but include the directory in operational snapshots if customer
invoice links must remain available during connector outages. Plan disk capacity
for roughly 50-500 KB per invoice PDF; 100,000 invoices can consume about
5-50 GB. Pre-release files under the old local `data/invoices` path are not
migrated by IMS because production installs are not live yet.
Branding upload URLs include a unique filename per upload so browser and CDN
caches do not depend on query-string cache keys. Avatar URLs preserve the
historical `/uploads/avatars/*` path and rotate a `?t=` cache-busting query
string on upload; configure any CDN in front of avatar assets to include query
strings in its cache key.

Invoice PDF scanning is disabled by default. Set `FILE_SCAN_MODE=command` and
`FILE_SCAN_COMMAND_ARGV='["clamscan","--no-summary","{file}"]'` or
`FILE_SCAN_COMMAND='clamscan --no-summary {file}'` to enable fail-closed
scanning. IMS writes uploaded PDFs to
`$UPLOAD_STORAGE_DIR/quarantine/invoices`, runs the command against the
quarantined path, and moves the file to `$UPLOAD_STORAGE_DIR/invoices` only when
the scanner exits `0`. Non-zero scanner exits reject the upload as unsafe;
spawn errors and timeouts also reject the upload. Rejected quarantine files are
deleted by default for disk hygiene; the activity log records scanner mode,
status, reason, exit code, signal, and scanner identifier without scanner output
or filesystem paths.

Scanner commands run without a shell. Prefer `FILE_SCAN_COMMAND_ARGV` when an
argument contains spaces or empty values. The scanner process receives only the
environment variables listed in `FILE_SCAN_ENV_ALLOWLIST`, which defaults to
basic process/runtime variables such as `PATH` and `TMPDIR`; application secrets
such as `DATABASE_URL` and `AUTH_SECRET` are not inherited. The admin health
endpoint runs a short scanner smoke check in command mode so misconfigured
scanner commands are visible before the first invoice upload.

Before starting or rolling a production instance, run:

```bash
NODE_ENV=production npm run preflight:production
```

The preflight checks required secrets, production URLs, PostgreSQL URL shape,
explicit persistent storage paths, writable upload/backup directories, scanner
policy and command health, trusted proxy configuration when
`REQUIRE_TRUSTED_PROXY_CONFIG=true`, and database-restore kill switches. Set
`PREFLIGHT_DB_CONNECT=true` during production rollout when the preflight process
can reach Postgres; this adds a short `SELECT 1` connectivity probe. It prints
variable names and status messages only; it does not print secret values.


## Application Service Management

Current installs run the application as a native systemd service named
`one-two-inventory.service`. Older deployments may still have PM2 installed, but
PM2 is not the current process manager for new installs.

### Common Commands

```bash
# View process status
systemctl status one-two-inventory.service

# View live logs
journalctl -u one-two-inventory.service -f

# Restart the application
systemctl restart one-two-inventory.service

# Stop the application
systemctl stop one-two-inventory.service

# Start the application
systemctl start one-two-inventory.service
```

The service is configured with:
- Automatic restart on crash
- Logs available through journald
- Boot persistence through systemd


## Cron Jobs

Scheduled tasks are configured automatically:

| Time | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| 01:00 | `/api/cron/account-balance-snapshot` | Fetch previous-day Xero Trial Balance account balances for GL variance reporting |
| 02:00 | `/api/cron/backup` | Scheduled backup (if enabled in settings) with retention and remote upload |
| 03:00 | `/api/cron/activity-cleanup` | Purge activity log entries past their retention period |
| 04:00 | `/api/cron/wc-reconcile` | WooCommerce backup reconciliation for orders/products plus stock retry draining |
| Every 15 min | `/api/cron/delivery-status` | Poll delivery tracking providers for shipment status updates |
| Every 5 min | `/api/cron/mintsoft-webhook-sweeper` | Drain persisted Mintsoft ASN booked-in webhook events |
| 06:00 | `/api/cron/fx-rates` | Fetch latest exchange rates from frankfurter.dev |

All cron jobs run under the `imsapp` user and call the application's API endpoints via `curl`. Cron endpoints require the `CRON_SECRET` bearer header in production, and production startup fails fast if `CRON_SECRET` is unset, blank, or shorter than 32 characters. Installer-generated crontab entries read only the `CRON_SECRET=` line from the protected `${APP_DIR}/.env` file at runtime so the cron secret is not embedded directly in the crontab and unrelated environment values are not shell-sourced. Localhost bypass is available outside production only when no `CRON_SECRET` is configured; production never accepts localhost cron requests without the bearer header. After a valid cron secret, each cron endpoint is rate-limited per job and source IP when a client IP is available: daily/hourly jobs default to one accepted run per hour, 5-minute jobs allow 15 accepted runs per hour, and 15-minute jobs allow 6 accepted runs per hour. The sub-hourly quotas intentionally include scheduling-jitter headroom and should not be tightened to the exact cadence. Rate-limited calls return `429` with `Retry-After`. Single-process installs can use the default in-memory rate-limit backend. Multi-replica or load-balanced installs must set `RATE_LIMIT_BACKEND=redis` and `REDIS_URL` so cron throttles are cluster-wide. Rotating `CRON_SECRET` requires updating both `.env` and any external cron scheduler invocations in the same maintenance window because the application reads the environment value on restart; if an old or leaked secret consumed cron quota, restart the memory backend or clear the Redis rate-limit keys rather than waiting for the one-hour window to expire.

For WooCommerce specifically:

- real-time order/product intake should come from webhooks
- `/api/cron/wc-reconcile` is the daily backup reconcile path for orders/products and also runs the stock catch-up plus queued retry drain

For Mintsoft specifically:

- accepted ASN booked-in webhooks return after persistence
- `/api/cron/mintsoft-webhook-sweeper` applies the pending stock and purchase-order effects asynchronously
- booked-in processing uses direct ASN lookup by default; `MINTSOFT_USE_BULK_ASN_LOOKUP=true` temporarily restores the legacy list-and-match path if Mintsoft endpoint discovery proves the direct path incompatible
- the sweeper drains up to `MINTSOFT_WEBHOOK_SWEEPER_PAGE_SIZE` persisted events per run; the default is `250`

Connector network requirements:

- WooCommerce and Mintsoft base URLs must use public HTTPS endpoints in normal operation.
- IMS rejects connector URLs that directly target localhost, loopback, RFC1918/private, link-local, multicast, or cloud metadata addresses. Local HTTP loopback URLs are accepted only for E2E tests with `E2E_TEST_MODE=1`, and this allowance is ignored when `NODE_ENV=production`.
- Connector HTTP requests validate DNS lookup results at connection time so a public-looking hostname cannot resolve or rebind to a blocked address.
- Connector redirects are followed only through the validated connector HTTP client. Every redirect hop is URL-validated and DNS-validated before connection, with sensitive headers stripped when the redirect crosses origins.
- Internal connector deployments behind a VPN should preferably be exposed to IMS through a public DNS name and public-routable gateway. If a private-IP connector target is unavoidable, set `CONNECTOR_PRIVATE_IP_ALLOWLIST` to a comma-separated list of exact IPs or CIDR ranges, for example `10.0.0.5,192.168.10.0/24`.
- The private-IP allow-list is intentionally narrow: it applies only to RFC1918 IPv4 or ULA IPv6 literal/DNS-resolved addresses, not `localhost`, loopback, link-local, metadata, multicast, credentials in URLs, fragments, query-string base URLs, or non-HTTPS production connector URLs.

Authentication note:

- login and TOTP throttling are currently in-process only
- this deployment assumes a single application instance/LXC
- if you add a second web instance or separate worker handling auth routes, move rate limiting to shared storage such as Redis before doing so
- if you deploy behind OpenLiteSpeed or another upstream proxy, strip/replace incoming `X-Forwarded-For` before proxying to the app tier
- set `TRUSTED_PROXY_IPS` / `TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS` so the app can walk the forwarded chain from right to left and ignore internal proxy hops
- set `REQUIRE_TRUSTED_PROXY_CONFIG=true` so `npm run preflight:production`
  fails if trusted proxy entries are missing on a proxied production deploy

### Settings Encryption Key Rotation

Sensitive connector settings are stored as AES-256-GCM ciphertext when `SETTINGS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is configured. The key must be exactly 32 raw bytes, or a base64 value that decodes to 32 bytes; ad-hoc strings are rejected rather than hashed into fallback keys. Current Setting-table ciphertexts use the `enc:setting:v1:` prefix and are authenticated against the setting key, so a ciphertext copied from one setting cannot be replayed into another setting. Existing plaintext settings remain readable and are lazily rewritten in encrypted form when read or saved. Older `enc:v1` values encrypted with `ENCRYPTION_KEY` also remain readable while that legacy fallback is set, but `ENCRYPTION_KEY` must follow the same 32-byte key-shape rule. If an existing install ever used an ad-hoc legacy key, follow `docs/encryption-key-migration.md` before deploying a strict key-shape build.

Run a one-shot migration after deploying the key to avoid waiting for low-traffic settings to be read:

```bash
npm run cli -- migrate-encrypted-settings
```

Environment variables for connector secrets take precedence over database settings. For example, when `WC_CONSUMER_SECRET` is non-empty, WooCommerce sync uses that value even if an operator saves a different value in the UI. Clear the environment variable and restart the app to use the database value. The connector settings UI shows a warning banner when an environment override is active.

To rotate from the legacy global key to the settings key, first deploy with both the old key as `ENCRYPTION_KEY` and the new key as `SETTINGS_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, then run `npm run cli -- migrate-encrypted-settings` or save each connector settings page so sensitive values are rewritten as `enc:setting:v1:` with the new key. After confirming no `enc:v1` values remain in the `settings` table, remove the legacy `ENCRYPTION_KEY`.

This release supports one active `SETTINGS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` plus the legacy `ENCRYPTION_KEY` fallback. It does not yet support a multi-key map for zero-downtime rotations between two settings keys; that is tracked in the follow-up plan.

Rollback note: application versions before this feature cannot read `enc:setting:v1:` values. Rolling back past this change requires either keeping this code deployed until the old version is no longer needed, or manually decrypting and rewriting affected rows to plaintext or legacy `enc:v1` before rollback.

## Base Currency

One Two Inventory stores foreign-currency transaction values alongside converted values in the organisation's base currency.

- Set the base currency once in **Settings > Company** during initial setup
- After transactional data exists, changing the base currency is blocked in the UI
- To use a different base currency later, reset the database and configure the system again from a clean state
- Base-currency amounts throughout the UI use the configured currency's symbol and symbol position, so currencies that render as prefixes or suffixes display correctly

If you use external connectors:

- **WooCommerce** may accept orders in many transaction currencies, but the store's configured currency must match the IMS base currency before the shopping connector can be enabled
- **Xero** must use the same organisation base currency as the IMS before the accounting connector can be authorised or enabled


## Reverse Proxy

The installer generates an nginx configuration at `/etc/nginx/sites-available/one-two-inventory` with:

- Upstream connection to the Next.js process on the configured port
- WebSocket support for hot-reload (development) and real-time features
- Security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, X-XSS-Protection, Referrer-Policy)
- Additional hardening headers (Permissions-Policy, COOP, CORP) and `server_tokens off`
- Client upload limit of 20 MB
- Extended timeouts for long-running requests (PDF generation, imports)
- Dedicated location block for webhook endpoints

## Host Security

The installer also applies low-risk host hardening:

- **fail2ban** enabled for `sshd` and, when nginx is configured, nginx auth/bad-bot jails
- **unattended-upgrades** enabled for security and updates repositories
- Existing active **ufw** setups are updated to allow ports `80` and `443`


## SSL

When SSL is enabled during installation, the script:

1. Installs **certbot** with the nginx plugin
2. Obtains a Let's Encrypt certificate for your domain
3. Configures automatic HTTPS redirect
4. Certbot handles automatic certificate renewal

To enable SSL after installation:

```bash
certbot --nginx -d ims.yourdomain.com
```
